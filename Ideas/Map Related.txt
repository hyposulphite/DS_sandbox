I notice that Google Maps actually has a roads API which provides a lot of functionalities:

* Snap to roads
* Nearest roads
* Speed limits

They also have distance matrix as well as travel time estimation (based on current and historical information). Moreover, there is another API to translate long/lat to address and vice versa. 

I am not sure what exactly can be done with all those functionalities but it seems that a lot can be done.

Moreover, google maps API has Python library and if one look hard enough, it seems that someone has created a R package(Not on CRAN): https://github.com/DerekYves/placement.

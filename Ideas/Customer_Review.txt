We can try to pull customer review from websites like Amazon, Yelp, TripAdvisor or Hotels.com. Several possible projects here:
1. Summarize topics from users' review. Understand what people like most and worry most about the product/hotel.
2. Understand how ratings are related to users' review. This can be conducted in two ways:
	a. Use user's rating as a label and analyze sentiment
	b. Check if there is significant difference between review sentiment and rating (unfair or fake rating)
3. Detect if there is any fraud (this is hard since we don't have labels, but being hard means we have a lot to improve). Several ideas here:
	a. Check superficial text appearance, like all upcase, many punctuation, etc.
	b. Check highly similar or repeated comments.
	c. Some hackers might randomly sample good comments and put them on. In this way good comments are like doubled.
	d. ... Anyway review fraud is hard but interesting. Just be creative on what would we do if we are going to hack :XXXD

# Some Examples of Good Projects. Keep Adding...

This is a list of good projects we found. We can get some ideas from them, as well as learn how to build a formal project.

- [klarsen1/NBA_RANKINGS](https://github.com/klarsen1/NBA_RANKINGS): A very nice project predicting NBA game results, as well as final ranking based on winning rates. No fancy technique is used here.

- [Path Matching](https://github.com/platypus1989/PathMatch): A R package to match trips based on simplifying trip with Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm. Potential future work: (1) match certain unknown trip with location points denoted by camouflaged/fake coordinates back onto google map. (2) include GPU computation capability in the path matching calculation.
